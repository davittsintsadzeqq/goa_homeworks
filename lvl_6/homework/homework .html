<h2>cheetah</h2>
<p>The cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus) is a large cat and the fastest land animal. It has a tawny to creamy white or pale buff fur that is marked with evenly spaced, solid black spots. The head is small and rounded, with a short snout and black tear-like facial streaks. It reaches 67–94 cm (26–37 in) at the shoulder, and the head-and-body length is between 1.1 and 1.5 m (3 ft 7 in and 4 ft 11 in). Adults weigh between 21 and 72 kg (46 and 159 lb). The cheetah is capable of running at 93 to 104 km/h (58 to 65 mph);[3][4] it has evolved specialized adaptations for speed, including a light build, long thin legs and a long tail.</p>
<h2>lion</h2>
<p>The lion (Panthera leo) is a large cat of the genus Panthera, native to Africa and India. It has a muscular, broad-chested body; a short, rounded head; round ears; and a hairy tuft at the end of its tail. It is sexually dimorphic; adult male lions are larger than females and have a prominent mane. It is a social species, forming groups called prides. A lion's pride consists of a few adult males, related females, and cubs. Groups of female lions usually hunt together, preying mostly on large ungulates. The lion is an apex and keystone predator; although some lions scavenge when opportunities occur and have been known to hunt humans, lions typically do not actively seek out and prey on humans.</p>
<h2>puma</h2>
<p>Puma (/pjumə/ or /pumə/) is a genus in the family Felidae whose only extant species is the cougar (also known as the puma, mountain lion, and panther,[2] among other names), and may also include several poorly known Old World fossil representatives (for example, Puma pardoides, or Owen's panther, a large, cougar-like cat of Eurasia's Pliocene).[3][4] In addition to these potential Old World fossils, a few New World fossil representatives are possible, such as Puma pumoides[5] and the two species of the so-called "American cheetah", currently classified under the genus Miracinonyx.[6]</p>
